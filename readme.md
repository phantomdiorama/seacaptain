### Changelog
- Mar 9, 2020: Version 1.5
    - SeaCaptain was conceived as a way to give a use to the useless `CapsLock` key. But after extended use the ergonomics were not quite right, so hotkeys have been adapted to use the `Win` key.
    - System menu items now work correctly.
- Feb 29, 2020: Version 1.0
    - First 'fully formed' version
    - Added openbox style menu
- Sep 1, 2019: Initial commit

### Tested On
Windows 10

### Issues
Terminal hotkeys require the new [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)
